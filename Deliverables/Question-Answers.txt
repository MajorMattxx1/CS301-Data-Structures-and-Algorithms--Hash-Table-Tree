1. Advantages: faster runtime, especially when searching for certain indexes/items.
   Disadvantages: More memory usage, far more complicated, at least at the moment, for the programmer

2. HashTable big O of add, remove, getItem (named lookupItem here), contains, and size have no loops, so big O for each is n.

3. Again, as explained in 2., so big O is n, or even less.
